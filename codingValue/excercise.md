# Coding Value

The Center for Productivity Measurement (CP/M) at the Alphametics Institute
is conducting a research project to assess the coding value (CV) of software
developers. For that purpose they asked 25 developers to state their four
favorite programming languages. Evaluation of the answers happens (naturally,
given the name of the institute) by appliying the methods of Alphametics.
That means each response is being treated as a simple equation where the
listed languages are added and compared against the word CODING. The equation
is solved by finding an assignment of the individual letters in that equation
to decimal digits so that the equation holds (i.e. becomes true). The CV is
then simply the right-hand side of the equation. Same digit means same letter
(the relation is bijective), but not all digits have to be used in all cases.
Leading zeros are not allowed. Each equation needs to be handled on its own.



As a simple example, the answer

Clive:EIFFEL,ALGOL

would result in the equation

EIFFEL+ALGOL=CODING

that resolves to

385531+91271=476802

giving Clive a (slightly below average) CV of 476802.


## Get your input file with all developers' feedback and answer these questions:



1) Which software developer has the best CV?



2) Which two responses are invalid (and why)?
